Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay Generally speaking, Artificial Intelligence is a computing concept that helps amachinethinkandsolvecomplexproblemsaswehumansdowithourintelligence.For example, we performa task, make mistakes and learn fromour mistakes (Atleast thewiseonesofusdo!).Likewise,anAIorArtificialIntelligenceissupposedtoworkonaproblem, makesomemistakes insolvingtheproblemandlearnfromthe problems in a self-correcting manner as a part of its self-improvement. Or inother words, thinkof this likeplayingagameof chess.Everybadmoveyoumakereduces your chances of winning the game. So, every time you loseagainst yourfriend, you try remembering the moves you made which you shouldn’t have andapplythat knowledgeinyour next gameandsoon. Eventually, youget better andyour precision, or in this case probability of winning or solving a problem improves by a noteworthy extent. AI is programmed to do something similar tothat!Artificial Intelligence vs Traditional Robotics Photo by Possessed Photography on Unsplash When we hear the word “Robot”, an image of a metal box with creepyeyes andspeaking in a mechanical voice pops into our head. I mean that’s what we havebeenwatchingintelevisionfor years, isn’tit?Andtoacertaindegreeweareright.Traditional robotics has been perceived by pop culture as an arena that createshumanlike machines to work for us as saviours and sometimes as super-villainsbringing in a cascade of tyranny into the human world. However, real liferobotsaren’t as humanlikeas wewantthemtobe,yet.Theyareprogrammedinaspecificway to only execute tasks that it has been programmedto perform. Imagineaself-drivingcarthathasbeendesignedtodriveyouonitsownaccordingtowhereyouinstruct it totakeyou. Nowfor atraditionalrobot,thecarisgoingtogothroughtheexact roadthatitwasprogrammedtoselectforacertaindestinationby its creators, possibly without the knowledge of traffic and cause accidents.However, a human driver would have chosen the shortest path or check whichpaths have the least traffic today and would be the most convenient pathfor thatparticular destination. That is theexact humanlikecreativethinkingthetraditionalrobots lack! They are fixed in their own “not so smart” way and are largelydependent ontheprogramtheyarebuilt onandtheinstructionsthattheyarebeinggiven. If acertaininstructiondoesn’t coincidewiththeir program, therobot won’teven be able to run, let alone going the extra step of being creative. This is thelimitation of traditional robots Artificial Intelligence is being developed toovercome. Unlike the conventional “bips and bops”, a good AI will simulate the complicated and intuitive sense of thinking and problem-solving abilities of thehuman mind. A Brief History of AI Theconcept of Artificial Intelligenceis notasmodernaswethinkitis.Thistracesbacktoas earlyas 1950whenAlanTuringinventedtheTuringtest.Thenthefirstchatbot computerprogram,ELIZA,wascreatedinthe1960s.

For instance, the machine is given a number of images ofdogs taken frommany different angles with colour variations, breeds and manymore diversity. So that, the machine learns to analyze data from these diverseimages of dogs and the “insight” of machines keep increasing and soon themachinecanpredict ifit’sadogfromawholedifferentpicturewhichwasnotevena part of the labelled data set of dog images themachine was fed earlier. Unsupervised learning: Contrary to the supervised learning, theunsupervised learning algorithms comprises analyzing unlabelled data i.e., inthiscase we are training the machine to analyze and learn froma series of data, themeaning of which is not apparently comprehendible by the human eyes. Themachine looks for patterns anddraws conclusions onits ownfromthepatterns ofthe data. Important thing to remember that the dataset usedinthis instanceis notlabelled and the conclusions are drawn by the machines. Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is a feedback dependentmachine learning model. In this process the machine is givenadataandmadetopredict what thedatawas.

AI at Work Today Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge The most common examples of uses of Artificial Intelligencecanbefoundtodayinsmart personal assistants likeApple’s Siri andAmazon’s Alexa. Peopleinteractwith these devices to command themon a daily basis and these devices use thecommands as a part of their dataset to learn from. Another known example ofArtificial Intelligence is the use of algorithms in Netflix. Netflix provides verymuchaccurateandrelevant suggestionsofmovies,tvseriesfromourdatawhichiscreated every time we streamor click onsomethinginNetflix. As thedataset forthese systems grows, their accuracy and precision increase as well.

The idea that weapons can be used to search and targetsomeonewithpre-programmedinstructions andthemisuseofthisbygovernmentsor mafias or rogue AI can be something very deadly and devastating. However,there are many myths in disguise of concerns surrounding AI that spreads panicandmisinformation. AI todayis nowherenear tobecomeasuper-intelligententityand turn into our overlords like in sci-fi movies. However, heavyregulations andcautions are being advised by Big Tech giants like Elon Musk while developingthis industry. Artificial Intelligence and The Future It is said that AI is thegreatest thinghumankindhas ever workedon. AI is beingused in image and speech recognition and analysis which will be far better thanhuman recognition of image and speech and its applicationstretches wide and far.ThereareresearchandworksbeingconductedusingAIthatisgoingtoplayaveryimportant roleinour futurehealthcare. AI is beingworkedontocureAlzheimer’sdisease and someday even blindness. Someone with dyslexia is being helped toread better with the help of AI. Geneticdatais beinganalyzedbybioinformatics;data science integrated with AI for waybetter dataanalysis inhealthcarethat hasnot been possible for us in the past. Fields like cancer research and other suchdiseases are being impacted greatly by advanced applications of AI. AI can be a great tool in the future of education. AI can be used to analyze data fromanindividual’s personal andintellectual needs, capabilities, choicesandlimitationstodevelop customized curriculum, strategies and schedules that will be more wellsuited, appeallingandinclusiveof most, if not all,childrenandadults.TheusesofAI are also going to change the way we are going to commute in the future. Inaddition to self-driving cars, work is being done to manufacture “self-flying”planes anddrones that convenientlydeliver your foodfaster andbetter.Oneofthebiggest concerns about AI is that jobs are being replaced due to automation.However, AI might be creating more jobs than it replaces. This will change theway humans work by creating new types of jobs.

Trainers, engineers, system designers andsoftware developer jobs in machine learning, data science and many suchrelatedfields are being createdinabundance. Newbusiness andinvestment opportunitiesare also on the rise due to endless AI applications in agriculture, education,transportation, finance, biotechnology, cybersecurity, gaming etc. As newbusinesses are being created so are new jobs.
